Code Analysis

################ Booking Controller ##################

I would say the code is just ok. I would be providing my suggestions regarding the code below.

-> First of all the issue is that request validators are not present in the code which may result in error if any parameter is missed.

-> Secondly the response of the data being returned should be in json format it is a cleaner way to return the data.

-> Request parameters can be accessed directly i.e.($request->var) no need to mention specially $request->get('var')

-> In the functions where database operations are being performed mostly try and catch block is missing, which can help tp commit and rollback the changes.

-> Instead of findOrFail only find method is being used which can not handle if data is not found. 

// Now I would be describing function wise

-> In index function the if elseif condition is wrong it will never check the role of the user as role check should be in another if block. In the written code, always the if block will be checked because user would be having id everytime and it would not check the else if condition.

-> The user roles should be defined in the database not in the environment file.

-> acceptJob and acceptJobWithId no need for functions separately it could be handled with one function only.

-> In distanceFeed function single array for updates could be made. Use null coalescing operator (??) to provide default values of null for $jobid if it's not present in the request.

-> resendNotifications and resendSMSNotifications function use the null coalescing operator (??) to provide a default value of null for $jobid if it's not present in the request.

First of all type-hint the dependencies (Model and MailerInterface) in the constructor parameters to improve code clarity and maintainability. Removed the call to parent::__construct($model) because it's not clear what parent class you are extending, and it's not necessary if you're not explicitly extending a parent class constructor.

-> Use ternary operators for concise assignments and if else if conditions

-> Improve naming conventions and remove commented-out code and unnecessary variable assignments.

-> Use an associative array to simplify data assignment.

-> Use consistent naming conventions for variables (camelCase).

-> Remove redundant code.

-> Use a separate variable, $logFilePath, to store the log file path to make the code more readable.

-> Use dependency injection for the MailerInterface instead of directly instantiating it within the constructor.

-> Split the logic for retrieving customer and translator jobs into separate private methods (getCustomerJobs and getTranslatorJobs) to improve readability and adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle.

-> Use proper naming convention $normalJobs instead of $noramlJobs 

-> ensure that $cuser exists before proceeding with job retrieval.

-> use the map method on the normalJobs collection to add the 'usercheck' property, making the code cleaner and more expressive

-> Utilize the DB::raw() method to directly handle custom SQL queries for ordering (orderByDesc('due')) to simplify the code.

-> Null coalescing operator ($request->get('page', 1)) to provide a default value of 1 for the page parameter if it's not provided.

-> Separate the validation and data processing logic into separate methods (validateCustomerData and processJobData) to improve code structure and readability.

-> Remove unnecessary ->first() calls and used direct property access

-> Utilize now() to get the current date and time.

-> Consolidate email sending logic

-> Simplify the logic using a switch statement for setting the jobType based on translatorType.

-> Simplify the retrieval of language IDs using pluck.

-> Use === for strict comparison.

-> Use a where query to filter the users collection for translators that meet the criteria.

-> Replace if statements with early returns for better code readability.

-> Combine the conditional check and return statement into a single if statement for clarity.
